  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I'm a local artist who simply loves playing boardgames, specifically Dungeons and Dragons.I started drawing Miniatures a local table that I run and people began to ask where I had bought them, and just like that Colossal RPG was born. Since then I've branched out into other things that everyone may need for their game. </p>
